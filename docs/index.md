## Core Features

### 1. **Expressive Language Components**

ASTx offers a rich suite of classes to describe essential language constructs
such as:

- `If` statements
- `For` loops
- `Function` declarations and usages
- Variables
- Data Types
- Operations
- And more

These classes enable a concise and clear representation, providing an intuitive
way to model various programming constructs.

### 2. **Symbol Table Class**

An integral part of ASTx, the Symbol Table class facilitates the translation of
ASTx expressions to other languages like LLVM-IR. This class acts as a mapping
layer, allowing a seamless connection between ASTx expressions and target
language representations.

### 3. **Language Agnostic Design**

Uniquely tailored to be independent of specific programming languages, ASTx
offers a flexible foundation. It strives to provide initial components that can
describe any programming language, giving users the freedom to work with
multiple languages effortlessly.

### 4. **Integration with Projects like ARX-IR**

ASTx has proven to be a vital tool in projects like ARX-IR, where it's leveraged
to translate Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) into LLVM-IR. This showcases the
library's adaptability and potential to serve as a foundational layer in various
applications.

## Why Choose ASTx?

ASTx is not just a library; it's a robust framework that fosters creativity and
efficiency in language processing. Its pythonic design, combined with the power
to handle different language constructs, positions ASTx as an invaluable
resource for developers and researchers alike.

Whether you're building a compiler, working on language translation, or
exploring new frontiers in programming language design, ASTx offers a reliable
and extensible toolkit to support your endeavors.
